\section{Introduction}

Modern businesses require efficient inventory management systems to track products, monitor stock levels, and generate meaningful reports. Our team developed a comprehensive web-based inventory management system that addresses these needs through a clean, intuitive interface backed by robust server-side logic.

The system manages product inventory across four distinct categories: Electronics, Supplies, Furniture, and Groceries. Each product maintains essential information including name, category, price (formatted in Kenyan Shillings), stock quantity, unique SKU identifier, and descriptive text. The application provides real-time dashboard analytics, advanced search capabilities, and comprehensive reporting features.

Built using Flask as the backend framework with PostgreSQL for data persistence, the system employs a RESTful API architecture that separates concerns between data management and user interface. The frontend utilizes modern JavaScript, CSS Grid layouts, and responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

\section{System Architecture}

The inventory management system follows a three-tier architecture that promotes maintainability and scalability. The presentation layer handles user interactions through a responsive web interface, while the application layer processes business logic via a Flask-based REST API. The data layer manages persistence through PostgreSQL with optimized indexing strategies.

    \caption{System Architecture Overview}
\end{figure}

The database schema centers around a single Products table that captures all necessary inventory information. This design choice simplifies queries while maintaining data integrity through database-level constraints. Primary keys ensure unique record identification, while the SKU field enforces business-level uniqueness across all products.

Key architectural decisions include environment-based configuration management, URL encoding for database passwords containing special characters, and strategic index placement on frequently queried columns. The Flask application configures template and static file directories relative to the backend folder, allowing proper resource resolution in the project structure.

\section{Core Functionality}

The system provides comprehensive product management capabilities through intuitive CRUD operations. Users can create new products by providing required information including name, category, price, stock quantity, and unique SKU. The update functionality allows partial modifications, preserving existing data for unchanged fields. Product deletion includes proper cascade handling to maintain data integrity.

Search functionality operates across multiple fields simultaneously, enabling users to locate products by name, SKU, or description content. The system implements case-insensitive matching to improve user experience. Category-based filtering helps users focus on specific product types, while stock status filtering identifies products requiring attention based on inventory levels.

Dashboard analytics provide real-time insights into inventory status. The system calculates total product counts, identifies low-stock items (those with fewer than 10 units), tracks out-of-stock products, and computes total inventory value. Category distribution statistics help managers understand inventory composition across different product types.

\begin{infobox}[Key Features]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-field product search across name, SKU, and description
    \item Real-time inventory tracking with automated low-stock alerts
    \item Category-based organization and filtering capabilities
    \item Comprehensive dashboard with key performance indicators
    \item Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop interfaces
\end{itemize}
\end{infobox}

The reporting module generates valuable business intelligence through aggregated data analysis. Stock movement tracking helps identify trends in inventory consumption, while category performance metrics guide purchasing decisions. The system formats currency values according to Kenyan standards, displaying amounts with proper thousand separators and the KSh prefix.

\section{Database Design and Implementation}

The PostgreSQL database employs a normalized structure centered on the Products table. This table captures essential product attributes while maintaining referential integrity through carefully designed constraints. The schema includes automatic timestamp generation for creation and modification events, enabling audit trail functionality.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption=Core Database Schema]
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    sku VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
\end{lstlisting}

Performance optimization relies on strategic index placement based on common query patterns. The system creates indexes on category, stock quantity, and name fields to accelerate filtering and search operations. A unique index on the SKU field enforces business rules while improving lookup performance.

Database security incorporates multiple layers of protection. Environment variables store sensitive credentials outside the codebase, while URL encoding handles special characters in passwords. The SQLAlchemy ORM provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through parameterized queries.

The Products model includes a comprehensive to\_dict method that serializes database records into JSON-compatible dictionaries. This approach centralizes data transformation logic and ensures consistent API responses. Timestamp fields receive proper ISO format conversion to maintain compatibility with JavaScript Date objects.

\section{Testing Strategy and Implementation}

Our testing approach encompasses multiple levels of validation to ensure system reliability and correctness. The test suite validates individual components, integration points, and end-to-end workflows through systematic verification procedures. We developed 76 distinct test cases covering various aspects of system functionality.

\subsection{Unit Testing}

Unit tests focus on individual components and functions within the system. Database model tests verify object creation, attribute assignment, and constraint enforcement. These tests ensure that the Product model correctly handles valid data while rejecting invalid inputs according to business rules.

The Product model undergoes rigorous validation testing. Tests verify that required fields generate appropriate errors when missing, numeric fields reject negative values, and the unique SKU constraint prevents duplicate entries. String representation methods receive validation to ensure proper object identification in logging and debugging scenarios.

Serialization testing confirms that the to\_dict method produces correctly formatted output with proper data type conversions. Price fields convert from Decimal to float for JSON compatibility, while timestamp fields transform into ISO format strings. These transformations maintain data integrity across system boundaries.

\subsection{API Endpoint Testing}

API endpoint tests validate the RESTful interface that connects frontend and backend components. Each endpoint undergoes testing for both successful operations and error conditions. Request validation ensures proper handling of malformed data, while response formatting confirms consistent API behavior.

Product retrieval endpoints face extensive testing across different scenarios. Tests verify that the system returns all products when no filters apply, correctly filters results based on category selection, and implements proper search functionality across multiple fields. Pagination logic receives validation to ensure proper data segmentation.

Creation and modification endpoints undergo thorough validation testing. Tests confirm that the system accepts valid product data and returns appropriate success responses. Error handling tests verify that missing required fields generate proper error responses without exposing sensitive system information.

\subsection{Integration Testing}

Integration tests validate interactions between different system components. These tests ensure that the Flask application correctly integrates with the PostgreSQL database, handles SQLAlchemy model interactions properly, and maintains data consistency across operations.

Full workflow testing simulates realistic user interactions by performing complete CRUD cycles. Tests create products, retrieve them through various endpoints, modify attributes, and verify deletions. This comprehensive approach validates that all system components work together correctly.

Database transaction testing ensures proper rollback behavior when errors occur. Tests verify that failed operations do not leave the database in inconsistent states and that concurrent access scenarios handle properly without data corruption.

\subsection{Error Handling and Edge Cases}

Error handling tests validate system behavior under adverse conditions. These tests ensure that the application gracefully handles database connection failures, invalid input data, and resource constraints without exposing sensitive information to users.

Edge case testing explores boundary conditions and unusual input scenarios. Tests verify proper handling of products with extremely long names, special characters in descriptions, and maximum price values. Unicode character support receives validation to ensure proper internationalization.

Security testing validates input sanitization and injection prevention mechanisms. Tests attempt various malicious input patterns to ensure that the SQLAlchemy ORM correctly prevents SQL injection attacks. Cross-site scripting prevention receives validation through HTML content testing.

\section{Test Results and Quality Metrics}

The comprehensive testing suite achieved complete success across all implemented test categories. Our 76 test cases passed without failures, demonstrating robust system implementation and thorough validation coverage.
